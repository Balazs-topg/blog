# blog
This repo is going to be a blog made with Next.js.

## purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn (esspecially backend APIs). This project is part of TOP (The Odin Project), but deviates in the stack a little bit in that TOP encourages the use of express and node. Here I will be using the backend capabilities of Next.js for the API. I think that doing it this way will make hosting a lot simpler (although in the future i want to do an app with a fullt seperate front and backend).

## stack
- MongoDB *(database)*
- Next.js *(framework, backend + frontend)*
- Tailwind *(styling)*
- NextUI *(component library)*

## details + more
The app will have login/signup and a demo account, so there will be authorization logic.
